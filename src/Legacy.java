	  		Inheritance (legacy) works according to a hierarchy system consisting of ChildClasses/SubClasses and ParentClasses/SuperClasses
	  		
	  		When it comes to inheritance (legacy) you should always start with a general class (ParentClasses/SuperClasses) from which the other classes (ChildClasses/SubClasses) should inherit 
	  		i.e. the more fundamentally you can summarize something, the more more important and useful the general class gets
	  		
	  		Legacy allows classes to be extended without directly changing them
	  		
	  		You create a new class and this new class inherits all the functionality of the class that is to be extended
	  	
	  		Files | "ClassCar.java" | "PropertiesAndAttributes.java" | "Constructor.java" | "MethodsOverloaded.java" | Legacy.java | ClassDog.java | ClassCat.java |
			| ClassAnimal.java | are related to file |"Classes.java"| and each other
