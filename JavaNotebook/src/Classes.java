											A class is a blueprint for an object: We define a class and use it to describe an object, we give the object attributes/conditions and methods to describe it and all of
											this is recorded in a class

											The blueprint is used to create objects that have the same basic structure, but can differ in e.g. attributes (the class creates 5 identical cars or 5 cars 
											with 5 different colors)
											
											First letter of a class-file should always be written in capital letters -> better overview to find classes faster
											
											Any number of objects can be created by a class in a program

											Each object stands on its own and is independent after creation
											
											The keywords "public" and "private" are visibility modifier

											Files | "ClassCar.java" | "PropertiesAndAttributes.java" | "Constructor.java" | "MethodsOverloaded.java" | Legacy.java | ClassDog.java | ClassCat.java |
