			A property/attribute is used to describe a class
		
			What distinguishes an attribute from an ordinary variable -> visibility modifier (public and private) at the beginning
		
			"public" -> everything has access | "private" -> only the class itself has access
		
			Visibility modifier -> controls the access permission to the respective attribute from outside the class
		
			Properties are usually set on "private" to maintain a clean code style (OOP) -> so you can distinguish code-blocks from each other
		
			The purpose of setters and getters is to provide controlled access to private attributes/properties
		
			Files | "ClassCar.java" | "PropertiesAndAttributes.java" | "Constructor.java" | "MethodsOverloaded.java" | Legacy.java | ClassDog.java | ClassCat.java |
			| ClassAnimal.java | are related to file |"Classes.java"| and each other
