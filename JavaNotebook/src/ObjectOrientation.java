			OOP: Object-oriented programming -> Objects: |[1] Descriptive things | [2] that can work together | [3] to help solve problems
			  
			-> Modern programming style
			
			-> Very close to human thinking (You or the computer in the middle and everything around you is an object)
			
			-> Used in for instance Java, C#[C-Sharp], C++ ...
			
			-> [1]: Descriptive things (objects) have properties/attributes such as color, shape, size etc. which allows us to describe things (objects) very precisely
			   [2]: Different things/objects can work together to achieve bigger accomplishments
			   [3]: Problem solving here refers to all the tasks that have to be completed in order to achieve a goal
			
			
			PP: Procedural programming -> Procedure: A sequence of steps
			
			-> Out dated programming style
			
			-> Procedures (a type of routine or subroutine) simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out
			
			-> Used in for instance C, COBOL, Pascal ...
			
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			
			Classes 
			
			- A blueprint for an object: We define a class and use it to describe an object, we give the object attributes/conditions and methods to describe it and all of this is recorded in a class
			
			- The blueprint is used to create objects that have the same basic structure, but can differ in e.g. attributes (the class creates 5 identical cars or 5 cars with 5 different colors)
			
			- Any number of objects can be created by a class in a program

			EXAMPLE VIDEOGAME
			
			-> Playable Character (Object)
				- Has life points (attribute/condition)
				- Has a name (attribute/condition)
				- Can move (method/function)
				- Can die (method/function)
			
			-> Chest (Object)
				- Can be closed or opened (attribute/condition) -> for instance a boolean: attribute/condition closed = false, attribute/condition opened = true (works for cases with ONLY two different conditions)
				- Contains things/items (attribute/condition) -> for instance an array: three different items can be put into an array and condition of chest can be: filled or not filled
				- Can be opened or closed (method/function) -> for instance a method: method(OpenChest) or method(CloseChest) can open or close the chest: a series of computational steps can be carried 
				  out with a method
